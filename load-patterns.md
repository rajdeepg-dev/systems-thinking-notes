## Load Patterns and System Stress

Backend systems often face different types of load patterns.

### Common Load Patterns

- Sudden traffic spikes during events or updates
- Gradual increase in user activity over time
- Batch processing causing temporary heavy load
- Read-heavy workloads
- Write-heavy workloads

### Why Load Patterns Matter

Understanding load patterns helps in designing scalable systems.
It helps developers decide:

- When to scale servers
- How to distribute traffic
- How to prevent system failures
