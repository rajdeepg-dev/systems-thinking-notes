## From Data to Backend Systems

Data analysis helps identify patterns and stress points.
Backend systems are responsible for handling those stress points
in real time.

Examples:
- High update frequency → backend load spikes
- Lifecycle events → predictable traffic patterns
- Metrics → guide system design decisions
